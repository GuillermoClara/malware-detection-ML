The objective of this study is to test how machine learning
can be used as a potential alternative to existing malware detection methods
(e.g. Signature based detection).

A total of 3800 malware and benign samples were collected for this study.
The features were extracted from executable files with a valid Windows Portable Executable Format.
As a result, this software can only work in computers running Windows OS.

The other important component of the research is exploring how Federated Learning, a relatively new
machine learning approach, can perform in the problem of malware detection.
